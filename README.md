# LabVIEW-Script-Interpreter
This is a pet project done for fun to create a plugin-based script interpreter natively on LabVIEW. Simply, this LabVIEW script interpreter can read in lines of text and do actions. Each line is a function and the interpreter knows to execute them based on the definition that we have provided. By default, there are functions already developed that are most commonly used like Arithmetic, Logical, String, Array, if statements, for statements, popups, printing to console, and in fact comments. All as a LabVIEW plugin. You can customize them however you wanted (modify the existing function behavior) or add new functions. (The default scripts resemble the python syntax format)

# LabVIEW Script Interpreter Capablities (This project is not complete)
1) LabVIEW based interpreter to understand the scripts based on the plugins and execute them
2) Bunch of plugin builtin to do basic data manipulation, flow control and few more
3) Ability for users to create a custom plugin and load it through factory pattern
4) Examples to demonstrate different use cases

# Software Dependency

NI LabVIEW 2019 (Github project is maintained in 2019 but can be used on higher version as well)
LabVIEW addons:
1) OpenG
2) JKI state machine for examples

# Building
To be updated
